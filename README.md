## **redux_2.1** Branch Overview

Welcome to **redux_2.1** of **Bit By Bit!**

In this branch, I focused on building Redux reducers to manage a complete to-do list application.  
This implementation allows users to efficiently add and delete tasks, clear completed items, and filter tasks by status or color â€” all while maintaining immutable state updates and clear action handling.
