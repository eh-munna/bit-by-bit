## **redux_2.2** Branch Overview

Welcome to **redux_2.2** of **Bit By Bit!**

In this branch, I focused on building Redux reducers to manage a complete product and cart management system.
This implementation allows users to efficiently add new products to the inventory, add products to the shopping cart, and automatically adjust stock levels â€” all while maintaining immutable state updates and clear action handling.
