# **Bit By Bit** - Fullstack Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal learning repo where I document my journey with:

- **React**
- **Redux**
- **TypeScript**
- **Mongoose**
- **Next.js**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Prisma**
- **Many more...**

---

The **`main`** branch acts as the central hub for documentation, while all the code and resources are organized across topic-specific branches.

---

## **Branch Organization**

Each branch contains:

- **Code examples** and exercises for the topic.
- **Summarized notes** with key points and insights in a `notes.md` file (if necessary).

---

## **How to Use the Bit By Bit**

Each branch corresponds to a distinct learning topic or concept. Branches are organized using a naming convention such as [branch number].[sub-branch number]. For example, code for Branch-1 Sub-1 is located in the `1.1` branch.

Follow the steps below to run different branches on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eh-munna/bit-by-bit
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository folder:**

   ```bash
   cd bit-by-bit
   ```

3. **Switch to a specific branch:**

   - For example, to switch to main branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Follow the README instructions** in the branch to run the code.
