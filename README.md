# **Bit By Bit** - Fullstack Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal learning repository, where I document my step-by-step journey to becoming a skilled developer.
This repo captures everything I learn—from programming fundamentals to frontend and backend technologies, and beyond.

---

## **What’s Inside**

This repository tracks my learning across multiple areas, including:

- **Programming Fundamentals** (C, C++, problem-solving, data structures, algorithms)
- **Frontend Development** (React, Redux, TypeScript, Next.js)
- **Backend & Databases** (Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Mongoose)
- **And much more…**

---

## **Main Branch – Central Hub**

The **`main`** branch serves as the **central hub**, providing:

- An overview of all learning paths and modules.

---

## **Branch Organization**

Each branch represents a **focused module or topic**. Branches are organized to make it easy to navigate and learn systematically.

Each branch may include:

- **Code examples** and exercises.
- **Notes** summarizing key concepts (`README.md`).
- **Practice tasks** or problem-solving exercises.

**Naming Convention:**
Branches are named using a descriptive and sequential format:

```
[topic-name]_[module-number]
```

**Examples:**

- `intro-to-programming-with-c_1.1` → Programming Fundamentals with C, Module 1.1
- `redux_1.1` → Redux Subtopic 1.1
- `typescript_2.3` → TypeScript Subtopic 2.3
