# **Bit By Bit** - Fullstack Learning Journey

## **Enhanced State Management and Event Handling**

---

Welcome to **redux_1.3** of the **Bit By Bit** project!

In this branch, I have expanded the Redux integration by improving state management for dynamic lists and implemented more robust event handling with vanilla JavaScript.

---

## **What’s New in This Branch**

- Managing dynamic collections of state objects (matches) effectively in Redux
- Implementing action creators for adding, deleting, incrementing, decrementing, and resetting scores
- Using event delegation to handle UI interactions efficiently
- Synchronizing UI and Redux state seamlessly through rendering on store updates
- Preventing default form behavior for better UX
- Cleaned up markup and selectors for maintainability and scalability

---

## **Branch Organization**

### **Key Topics Covered**

- Advanced usage of Redux reducers with arrays of objects
- Action payload design and usage in Redux actions and reducers
- Vanilla JavaScript DOM event handling with event delegation
- Updating UI reactively on Redux state changes
- Form submission prevention and input event handling
